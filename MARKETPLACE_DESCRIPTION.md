### 🎯 Never Lose Track of Your If Statements Again!

Have you ever been deep in a complex codebase, scrolling through a long if statement, only to find yourself at the closing brace wondering "which condition was this again?" 

**If-End Marker** solves this problem by displaying the original condition right where you need it - at the closing brace.

```javascript
if (user.isAuthenticated && 
    user.hasPermission('admin') && 
    !user.accountLocked) {
    // ... 50 lines of code ...
    
    performAdminAction();
    updateAuditLog();
} // user.isAuthenticated && user.hasPermission('admin') &&...
  ↑ This appears automatically!
```
