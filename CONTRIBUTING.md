## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused

### Code Style

- 4 spaces for indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons at the end of statements
- Opening braces on the same line
- Use `const` by default, `let` when needed, never `var`

Example:
```typescript
/**
 * Formats the condition text for display
 */
export function formatCondition(condition: string, maxLength: number): string {
    if (condition.length <= maxLength) {
        return condition;
    }
    return condition.substring(0, maxLength - 3) + '...';
}
```

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Examples:
```
Add support for MDX files

- Parse .mdx files as JavaScript
- Update supported languages list
- Add tests for MDX parsing

Fixes #123
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Test manually in the extension development host
- Test with different file types and edge cases

Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```
